## Class Log

### Thu 10 Feb 2022

- Dakotah finished presenting his [pleb slides](readings/pleb.pdf).
- We discussed local, piecewise, and tier-based local factors as the parts of the whole that are used to determine a sequence's well-formednes. These were motivated by natural language examples shown on slides 7 and 17-21 of [this talk](readings/oxford-typology-computation.beamer.pdf)
- We finished reviewing chapter 3 of Hutton.
- For next Tuesday:
  - Read up to and including section 4.4. of Hutton. (So not section 4.5) 
  - Do exercises 1-6 at the end of Hutton chapter 4. Fork [HW02](https://github.com/Compling2-Spring2022-SBU/HW02), complete the exercises in one of the `.hs` or `.lhs` files there, and submit a pull request to submit your answers.
  - Please contact Dakotah or myself if you have any questions about this. We are here to help. 

### Tue 08 Feb 2022

- We went over exercise 7 on rewrite grammars.
- We reviewed chapter 3 of Hutton.
- Dakotah presented on the piecewise-local expression builder (pleb) [slides](readings/pleb.pdf)
- For Thursday
  - Review class materials and begin reading section 4 of Hutton if so inclined.

### Thu 03 Feb 2022

- Today we finished the handout on rewrite grammars. 
- We reviewed chapter 2 of Hutton.
- I reviewed a bit of what is known if we think of natural languages as formal languages in slides 14-15 of [this talk](readings/umcp-cogsci-may2010.beamer.pdf).
- For Tuesday
  - For fun, work on exercise 7 in the [the handout on formal
  languages and grammars](readings/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
  - Read Chapter 3 of Hutton and complete all the exercises at the end
    of the chapter.
  - Fork [HW01](https://github.com/Compling2-Spring2022-SBU/HW01), complete the exercise and submit a pull request to submit your solution.

### Tue 01 Feb 2022

- Today we reviewed chapter 1 of Hutton.
- We went over section 4 of [this handout on formal
  languages and grammars](readings/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Thursday:
  - For a fun puzzle, work on exercise 5 on page 6 of the handout. 
  - Read Chapter 2 of Hutton and complete all the exercises at the end
    of the chapter.
- For next Tuesday set up a text editor for working on Haskell programs. Haskell's recommended IDEs are here: [https://wiki.haskell.org/IDEs](https://wiki.haskell.org/IDEs)

### Thu 27 Jan 2022

- Today we finished the discussion around different kinds of regular
  expressions (RE, GRE, CUE, SFE).
- For next Tuesday, please do the following
  - Read Chapter 1 of the Graham Hutton Book on Haskell and do
    exercises 1-5 in section 1.7 at the end of the chapter.
  - Read sections 4 and 5 of the
    [handout](readings/rewrite-grammars.pdf) on rewrite grammars.
  - Come prepared to ask questions about both!

### Tue 25 Jan 2022

- Today we introduced the course and went over the syllabus.
- we went over the first two pages of [this handout on formal
  languages and grammars](readings/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Thursday:
  - Please make sure you have a github account set up and send me your
    username so I can add you to the "Compling2-Spring2022-SBU" github
    organization.
  - Complete exercise 1 on page 2 of the handout. 
  - Install Haskell using GHCup. [Instructions are
    here.](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) If you need assistance,
    please let us know asap. We are happy to help. Windows users may
    want to install the [Windows Subsystem for
    Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) or set up a
    [Virtual Machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with a Linux
    distribution (such as Ubuntu) running on it. [Instructions for how
    to install Ubuntu on a virtual machine are
    here.](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-run-ubuntu-desktop-on-a-virtual-machine-using-virtualbox#1-overview)
